The Venues App.

This app was built out with Full-Stack in mind. I created it in a week using the following technologies: EJS, Materialize CSS, HTML, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose and Espress.

The puprose of this app is designed to be a database that leverages crow-sourced information. In essense - it is a peer to peer review site for folks that like to go out in New York City. The 5 venues that I initially included are some of my favorite places to frequent when I'm in New York.

With time I intend to add user authentication and allow for people to log in, add a comment and actually use this site for figuring out where to go for a night out.
